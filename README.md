# MRI_Time_Logic

  Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) is a medical imaging technique used in radiology to
form pictures of the anatomy and the physiological processes of the body in both health and disease.
In this project we would be analyzing some of the MRI scan data where we would be understanding
the given data set of MRI scan values and performing few data transformation for data analysis and
data visualization.

  With this project we will be able to analyze which is the most used procedure number, Cpt
code, reason and priority for the most MRI scans in the duration of a year starting April 2017 until
April 2018. With the analysis information we will be able to provide details to the health care client
help understand what needs more attention.

  Starting this project, we will be transforming the data collecting information of duration then
analyze and visualize the data based on the relation between duration to other attributes mentioned
in the dataset. We would be using Python programming in PyCharm for data transformation and
Tableau software for data analysis and data visualization.
